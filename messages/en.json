          "question": "What color braces should I get?",
          "answer": "The best braces color depends on your skin tone, tooth color, and personal style. Popular choices include white/silver (makes teeth look whiter), light blue (fresh and natural), pink (cute and feminine), black (bold and fashionable), and purple (fun and creative). Consider your skin tone - fair skin looks great with bright colors, while darker skin suits deeper colors."
        },
        "item-2": {
          "question": "What are the best colors for braces?",
          "answer": "The most popular braces colors are: white/silver (makes teeth appear whiter), light blue (fresh and natural), pink (cute and feminine), black (bold and fashionable), and purple (fun and creative). These colors are popular because they complement different skin tones and personal styles while making teeth look their best."
        },
        "item-3": {
          "question": "What color braces make your teeth look whiter?",
          "answer": "White, silver, and light gray braces make teeth look whiter because they create good contrast with teeth. Light blue and light pink can also brighten teeth. Avoid choosing braces colors that are too close to your natural tooth color, as they won't provide enough contrast."
        },
        "item-4": {
          "question": "Is black a good color for braces?",
          "answer": "Black can be a good braces color if it complements your skin tone and personal style. It's bold and fashionable, creating strong contrast that can make teeth appear whiter. However, it may be too dramatic for some people or formal settings."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "Is pink a good color for braces?",
          "answer": "Pink can be a great braces color, especially for those with fair skin. It's cute, feminine, and can make teeth look whiter by creating contrast. Pink is popular among younger patients and those who want a softer, more feminine look."
